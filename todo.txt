add statictext or drawstatictext ? remove monotonous bind / draw code

IsShiftPressed() IsCtrlPressed() for multiselection

menuitems are commandbuttons, not itembuttons

remember menus can have submenus as items

listbox polymorphic for multilistbox ? virtual SelectItem()

generalize lists to more than just boxes (think of item and icon selections)

provide alternatives to left-justified textbuttonbrushes

file/stream loading utilities should use exceptions

list/menu separators
button groups
tab-groups
listboxes
check box (just a switch button?)
menu (or menu panel?)
menu bar

scroll fixtures
resizer borders/frames
title bars

dialog panel

frame window manager:
-contains info about active frame (to give active colors to)
	-info propogates using something like MakeParentTopFJwelfjwlef()
-can be contained to create MDI child frames inside a frame?

frame window:
invisible main rectangle for glue
resizing border (non-pickable if no resize)
gradient titlebar
optional menu
draw a sink
window content (client area)
(either a single control to match sizes with the frame (like wxSizer), OR
	some kind of background window that has child windows of its own)

resize border changes mouse cursor brush OnMouseOver() and OnMouseLeave()

key-routing to fake keyboard focus

update linux makefile

dialogs and frames have their destructor call RemoveFromParentList()
think about possible handles to controls (created dynamically? from a manager?)


clean up so that python can be tested

boost bug report for pooled vectors

template terminals, so that editbox/lines can be replaced with framed versions?
or maybe just change the editboxbrush to draw frames...


layout managers for dialogs and frames? (like wxSizer?)
primary layout for a dialog that is activated from parent dialog's OnResize()
can resize/reposition child layouts and windows

layouts won't interfere with mouse selection, because they don't have to be added to the dialog's child list, but they can maintain their own hierarchy


add "active" visual state for buttons buttons
possible:
mouseover activeness (hover)
active button that is externally pointed at by a dialog? (if you press enter, that button will be pressed? works with tabs?) [button groups?]

progress bars

bevels with gradient shading
text characters outlined
look at S.K.A.T.E. game library for visual inspiration:

audio

RakNet

fix strange font problems with thin letters at right of screen:
	(f, t, j) arial font


variable frustum for PerspectiveView, gluPerspective?



add some system logging


move renderer managers to a better class? giant resource manager?


parent-inherited alpha?

signals-slots for messages?

scriptable-window class
xml-loading gui?

signal/slot commands

scrollbar controller defaults:
	-for controlling values
	-for controlling window offsets

bold, italics and underlining


"Bitstream Vera" fonts

html-tag colored document
keyword colored document


Vertex Buffer Objects:

Add Model Data:
-Access first of a series of VBOs, and iterate until finding a home
-Is this VBO empty? (if yes, then load data here)
-If not empty, does this data fit the size cap? (if yes, then load)
-If not, go to next VBO



Cal3D "Character Animation Library"

Blender for models? (supports python scripting)

Particles	(emitters and affectors)
: gravity, other forces
-energy left
-position (x, y)
-velocity (x, y)

update the profiler? (maybe i don't care?)

further work on unicode text string support

try to support all characters in any given ttf file (unicode?)

makefile generation (automake, autoconf?)
